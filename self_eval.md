# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  * I feel mostly good about using built-in Ruby methods since I can refer to the [Ruby Strings Doc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/String.html#method-i-slice) to find new methods to try. I can also test them out in the low stakes environment of `irb`. Some of the methods are hard to understand what the outcome means which I believe will just come with more practice and time.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
 * I feel okay about writing methods of my own. The ones I have tried so far make sense, but making sure I have the format of the code correct to get the return values I want sometimes takes me a few tries. For example, when trying to insert a string argument, I was not including the `#{}` so kept getting an error. Again I think this will improve over time (and eventually be second nature) as I start reading and writing more code. Will definitely commit time to continue to read/practice leading up to Module 1.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  * How would you write a method that includes an array, but then only pulls out one of the data types in the return value?
